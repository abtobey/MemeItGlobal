Project title: Meme It: Global!
Project description: Our app will allow the user to generate a meme and translate it
User story: As a meme aficionado,
	            I want to be able to create memes in any language
	            so that I can participate in the world around me.
	            Given the tools to customize my meme,
	            when I run my text through the translator,
	            then I will have a fully adaptable meme!
