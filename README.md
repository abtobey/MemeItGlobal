# Project1: Meme It: Global!
### Created by: Aaron, Luis, and Nicci

## Elevator Pitch 
Do you use memes? Do you or anyone you know speak more than one language? If so, you'll love our new app, Meme It: Global! Make memes, translate memes, store memes, delete memes, and even share memes! 

## Project description and Usage 
Our app will allow the user to select a meme and customize it in the language of their choice! 

First, the top drop down menu will generate the list of the top 100 most popular memes. 
Then, the user can create their meme by inputting their text - in the language of their choice. 
Users can also choose a different font, delete memes, and even store their custom memes on their page. 
Lastly, your memes will post to ImgFlip's hosting site for you to share!

## User story 
	As a meme aficionado,
	I want to be able to create custom memes in any language
	so that I can meme around the world!
	Given the tools to build my creation,
	when I build my meme on Meme It: Global,
	then I will have a custom meme to share!
