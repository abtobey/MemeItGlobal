# Project1: Meme It: Global!
###Created by: Aaron, Luis, and Nicci

## Project description and Usage 
Our app will allow the user to select a meme and customize it in the language of their choice! 
First, the top drop down menu will generate the list of the top 100 most popular memes. 
Then, the user can customize the meme of their choice with their text input. 
Afterwards, they can select one of seven languages in which to translate their meme. 
Lastly, they can post the meme to ImgFlip's hosting site!

## User story 
	As a meme aficionado,
	I want to be able to create custom memes in any language
	so that I can meme around the world!
	Given the tools to customize my meme,
	when I run my text through the translator,
	then I will have a fully adaptable meme!
